# REST_API_Example

## What is REST API?
REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer and API stands for Application Programming Interface.It is an API architecture with design principles for **client-server** communication and features.  
RESTful APIs communicate through HTTP requests to perform CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations in a resource. These operations correspond with method requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). A POST request adds information, a GET request retrieves information, a PUT request updates information, and a DELETE request deletes information.
